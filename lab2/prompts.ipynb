       "The creation of black holes is a complex astrophysical process that involves the collapse of massive stars under their own gravity. According to the theory of general relativity proposed by Albert Einstein, a black hole is formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion and its core collapses into a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process begins with the depletion of a star's fuel, typically hydrogen, which causes a reduction in the outward pressure that supports the star against its own gravity. As the star's core contracts, its density and temperature increase, leading to a series of nuclear reactions that ultimately result in the formation of iron, the most stable element.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, iron is unable to generate further energy through nuclear reactions, and the star's core begins to collapse under its own gravity. If the star is sufficiently massive, typically above 20-30 solar masses, the core collapse will overcome the degeneracy pressure of electrons and lead to a catastrophic implosion.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the core collapses, a massive amount of matter is compressed into an infinitesimally small space, creating an intense gravitational field that warps the fabric of spacetime around it. This warping creates a boundary called the event horizon, which marks the point of no return around a black hole. Any matter or radiation that crosses the event horizon is trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mathematical framework for understanding black hole formation is based on the Einstein field equations, which describe the curvature of spacetime in the presence of mass and energy. Numerical simulations using these equations have been used to model the collapse of massive stars and the formation of black holes, providing valuable insights into the physics of these extreme objects.\n",

       "## Step 4: Develop a method to check for primality\n",
       "To check if a number is prime, we will test if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. For efficiency, we only need to check up to the square root of the number, as any factor larger than that would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n",

       "## Step 5: Implement the primality check\n",
       "We will iterate through each odd number from 3 to 9999 and check if it is prime by testing divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, incrementing the test divisor by 2 each time (since we're only interested in odd divisors).\n",

       "Create a boolean array, prime, of size 10000. Initialize all entries as true. A value in prime[i] will finally be false if i is Not a prime, else true. Start from 2, and for every prime number encountered, mark its multiples as non-prime.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Step 9: Count the odd primes using the sieve\n",

However, the Acts of Union in 1707 united the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.
